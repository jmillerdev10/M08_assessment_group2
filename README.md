# Census API Data - Annual Business Survey 2019
### Group 2: Gavan VanOver, James Miller, Norman Morris, Yiqing Guo 

The US Census Bureau is constantly collecting vast amounts of data from the country over all sorts of topics. The topic of interest for this project is the Annual Business Survey for 2019 which, according to census.gov, “combines data results from survey respondents and administrative records to produce data on business ownership”. The survey itself had four different APIs: “Company Summary”, “Characteristics of Business”, “Characteristics of Business Owners”, and “Technology Characteristics of Businesses”. Each of these APIs contained different data but we decided to focus specifically on data relating to family-owned businesses and therefore we only used data from two of the APIs.
